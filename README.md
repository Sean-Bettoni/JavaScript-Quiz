# JavaScript-Quiz
The purpose of this assignment was to create a timer based JavaScript quiz with vanilla JavaScript that performs the following;

When the start button is clicked a timer starts and you are presented with a multiple choice question. When the question is answered you are presented with another question. If the question is answered incorrectly time is subtracted from the timer, when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 the game is over and you can save your score with your initials.
